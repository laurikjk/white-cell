# Laser Reflections in an Ellipse

This project focuses on the simulation and visualization of how lasers behave when reflected inside an elliptical shape.

## Production

Experience the live version of the project here: [white-cell.laurikjk.com](https://white-cell.laurikjk.com/)

## Key Features

- **Ellipse Equation Input**: Users can input the specific parameters of the ellipse equation, tailoring the simulation to different elliptical shapes.
- **Initial Laser Beam Input**: Users can draw the initial laser beam, setting the entry point and direction of the laser.

## Future Improvements

- **Laser Entry Precision**: Currently, the laser entry point is fixed at 0.2 units wide on the x-axis. Future updates could include adjustable entry sizes for greater flexibility.
- **User Interface Enhancement**: While functional, the input form is a bit crude. Future versions could see an enhanced UI for an improved user experience.
- **Internal Quality**: There are a few areas that could use the DRY principle and there are no tests due to time constraints.
